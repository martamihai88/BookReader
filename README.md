# Book Reader Project

This is a project developed with the React framework , it is a book tracking app that will let you search for books with the help of an API  and add them to your virtual library.

## Instructions 

* To run the project the user needs to clone or download the repository from: [Github-link](https://github.com/martamihai88/BookReader) and 
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`.
* To open the project the user needs to start the  server with `npm start` and visit http://localhost:8000 .
* 

## What You're Getting
    
* In this application , the main page displays a list of bookshelves ordered into 3 categories ('Currently Reading', 'Want to Read', 'Read'). 
* The user can manage the books in the shelves by moving them to the category of choice and also add new books to the library from the search function.

## Important

* Search results are limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work , so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
